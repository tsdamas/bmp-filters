# bmp-filters
Welcome to my filter-more solution for one of the CS50 problem set! Here, you'll find my solution for one of the problem sets from Harvard's renowned CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. This problem set involves creating bmp images filters: blur, reflection and edges filter. 

NOTE: Please be aware that duplicating this code and submitting it as your own work is a violation of CS50's academic integrity policy, which can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/. I strongly encourage you to thoroughly grasp the course material and independently craft your solution. It's a valuable learning experience!

## Description

This C problem set involves implementing bitmap image filters: blur, reflection, and edges filter. The task revolves around manipulating pixel values in a bitmap image to achieve specific effects.

For the blur filter, I iterate through pixels and update their values based on neighboring pixels to create a smooth, blurred effect.

The reflection filter aims to create a mirrored effect of the original image, I achieved by reversing pixel values horizontally.

Finally, the edges filter involves detecting edges within the image, I examined the differences in pixel values to highlight boundaries and contours.


On this problem I have completed:
